    <h1>My Favs</h1>

    <p>The page will show the the many things I like doing. These will range from items, hobbies, and some of my closest friends.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>My freinds</h2>
    <p>My friends are amazing. I love hanging around them (like how all friends should be). If you don't like hanging around your friends. Are they your friends?
        <br>
        I have know all of them since 1st grade and they all have cool and unique talents. This ranges from being funny, to smart, or even just comforting. <br>
        The list below this isn't in order but here are the names of my friends.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jaxon</li>
        <li>Durgesh</li>
        <li>Ryvr</li>
        <li>Ivan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jaxon is the goofy kid. He makes the whole group laugh, but he can be serious if needed. <br>
    Durgesh is the smart kid. If you need help in anything, hes alway there. <br>
Ryvr is a good blend of both smart and funny. He recently moved away so we haven't talked in awhile. <br>
Ivan is the new comer. He moved here last year and been a great addition to the group.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I'm a pretty active person. I like going outside but socializing isn't my strong suit. <br>
     But during indoor, I like gaming, coding, watching videos, and just hanging out with my family. <br>
