    <div class="div-2">
        <h2 class="v1">Violins</h2>
        <p class="para-2">The smallest but most used out of all three. <br>
        With this instrument, you can play the highest <br>
         note of them all (E string) <br>
        Violins makes up about 2/5th of an orchestra. <br>
        We play the main part of the song, called the melody.</p>

    <div class="div-3">
        <h2 class="v2"> Violas</h2>
        <p class="para3">
            Violas are the second largest instrument out of the string family. <br>
            they have a mid tone, making them very versatile. <br>
            this means that they can play high and low notes. They pair well with the cello as <br>
            the melody. Many people have a hard time seeing the difference <br>
            between the violin and the violas.

    <div class="div-4">
        <h2 class="v3"> Cellos</h2>
        <p class="para4">
            Last up, the big Cellos. Cellos are the biggest out of all three instruments <br>
            they have a rich deep sound whom adds that extra depth into a song. <br>
            They are so big that the user must lay the cello over there body to use. (not holding up) <br>
            They usually get the background music. People think thats lame but a matter of fact, <br>
            its very important.
